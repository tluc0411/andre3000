										Born in 1975 in Atlanta, Ga, André 3000 began performing in his teens with a friend as 2 Shades Deep. They got a record deal and changed their name to OutKast. Their first single, 1993's "Players' Ball," was a Christmas song, and it stayed at No. 1 on the rap charts for six weeks. By the end of the decade, OutKast was a known force in the Hip Hop genre, and their single "Hey Ya!" cemented the group's reputation. The song went on to be named one of Rolling Stone's top 500 songs of all time, and OutKast collected six Grammy Awards along the way. Soon after, Andre 3000 began acting, appearing in several movies and on television, while also writing music for both. His latest effort is portraying Jimi Hendrix in the 2013 biopic All Is by My Side.</p>

									<p class="info">On May 27, 1975, André 3000 grew up being called "Dre" by his mother, who raised him by herself and sold real estate. He grew up in East Point and Buckhead, Georgia, and attended Willis A. Sutton Middle School and Tri-Cities High School for the Performing Arts, where his artistic leanings were encouraged. While at Tri-Cities, he met Antwan Patton, and the two quickly became rivals on the school's rap scene. Just as quickly, though, the two realized that their shared love of music would bring them together, and they became lifelong friends.</p>

									<p class="info">When André began to rebel as a teenager, his mother sent him to live with his father, Lawrence Walker, but Walker couldn't, or didn't want to, curtail André's rebellious streak, and André dropped out of high school during his junior year (he would later earn his GED). Like most teenagers, André spent a lot of his time hanging around malls, but he and Patton used these locales as performance spaces, forming a musical duo called 2 Shades Deep, and rapping for throngs at shopping centers and in parking lots.</p>
